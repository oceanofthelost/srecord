\*
   It is now possible to have negative expressions on the command line,
   to facilitate “--offset - -minimum foo” usages.

\*
   The *srec_cat*\ (1) command now has a simple hexadecimal dump output
   format.

\*
   The use of *uudecode*\ (1) in the tests has been removed, so
   *sharutils* is no longer a build dependency.
