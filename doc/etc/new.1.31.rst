\*
   The TI‐TXT format output has been improved; it is less spec
   conforming but more reality conforming. It now allows odd alignment
   without padding. It also ends with a ``q`` instead of a ``Q``.

\*
   The warning for odd input addresses has been dropped. The spec didn't
   like them, but the MSP430 handles them without a hiccup.
