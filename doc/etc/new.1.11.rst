   It is now possible to put **-minimum** *input.spec* (also
   **-maximum** and **-length**) almost anywhere on the command line
   that you can put a number. It allows, for example, the -offset value
   to be calculated from the maximum of the previous file. The values
   calculated by **-Minimum**, **-Maximum** and **-Length** may also be
   rounded to arbitrary boundaries, using **-Round_Down**,
   **-Round_Nearest** and **-Round_Up**.

   The malformed Motorola S5 records output by the Green Hills tool
   chain are now understood.
