\*
   The CRC16 code has been enhanced to provide low‐to‐high bit order, in
   addition to the previous high‐to‐low bit order. It is also possible
   to specify the polynomial, with the default the CCITT standard
   polynomial, as was in the previous code. See *srec_input*\ (1) for
   more information.

\*
   The MD5, RipeMD‐160, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA 512 and
   Whirlpool message digests are now supported. See *srec_input*\ (1)
   for more information.

\*
   There is a new *srec_cat -bit‐reverse* filter, that may be used to
   reverse the bits in each data byte. See *srec_input*\ (1) for more
   information.
