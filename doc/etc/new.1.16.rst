   There is now support for Intel Extended Segment addressing output,
   via the --address‐length=2 option.

   There is now support for output of Verilog VMEM format. See
   *srec_vmem*\ (5) for more information.

   There is now support for reading and writing the INHX16 format, used
   in various PIC programmers. It looks just like the Intel Hex format,
   except that the bytes counts and the addresses refer to words (hi,lo)
   rather than bytes. See *srec_intel16*\ (5) for more information.
