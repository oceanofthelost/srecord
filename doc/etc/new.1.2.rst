\*
   A bug has been fixed which would cause the crop and exclude filters
   to dump core sometimes.

\*
   A bug has been fixed where binary files were handled incorrectly on
   Windows NT (actually, any system in which text files aren't the same
   as binary files).

\*
   There are three new data filters. The --OR filter, which may be used
   to bit‐wise OR a value to each data byte; the --AND filter, which may
   be used to bit‐wise AND a value to each data byte; and the
   --eXclusive‐OR filter, which may be used to bit‐wise XOR a value to
   each data byte. See *srec_cat*\ (1) for more information.
