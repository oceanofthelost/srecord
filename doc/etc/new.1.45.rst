\*
   There is a new option for the --*x*\ ‐e‐length filters, they can now
   accept a width, and this is divided into the byte length, so that you
   can insert the length in units of words (2) or longs (4).

\*
   Some small corrections have been made to the documentation.

\*
   The -minimum and -maximum options have been renamed -minimum‐address
   and -maximum‐address, to avoid a command line grammar syntax problem.
