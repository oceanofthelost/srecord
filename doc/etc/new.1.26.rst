   [SourceForge Feature Request 1597637] There is a new warning issued
   when input data records are not in strictly ascending address order.
   There is a new command line option to silence the warning.

\*
   [SourceForge Feature Request 1592348] The command line processing of
   all srecord commands now understands ``@``\ *file* command line
   options, filled with additional space separated strings witch will be
   treated as of they were command line options. This gets around
   absurdly short command line length limits in some operating systems.
