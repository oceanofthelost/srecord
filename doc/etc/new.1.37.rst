\*
   The CRC16 filters now support a -Broken option, to perform a
   common‐but‐broken CRC16 calculation, in addition to the CCITT and
   XMODEM calculations.

\*
   A link has been added to the CRC16 man page section to the
   www.joegeluso.com/software/articles/ccitt.htm web page, to explain
   the difficulties in seeding CRC16 calculations.

\*
   A buglet has been fixed in the *srec_motorola*\ (5) man page, it now
   includes ``S6`` in the list of things that can appear in the type
   field.

\*
   The ability to negate expressions is now mentioned in the
   *srec_examples*\ (1) man page.
