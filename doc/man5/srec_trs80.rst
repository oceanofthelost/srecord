srec_trs80 - Radio Shack TRS‐80 object file format specification

DESCRIPTION
===========

This document describes the binary object file format for the Z80‐based
Radio Shack TRS‐80 microcomputers, such as the Model I, II, III, 4, 4D,
and 4P. The binary format is generated by the disk‐based
Assembler/Editor, and used for TRS‐DOS program files.

The object file is blocked into records, each of which contains the
record type, length, and payload data. For Data and End of File records,
the payload starts with two bytes of address in little‐endian format.
There are four main types of records that are defined. The record types
are:

·
   Data Record

·
   End of File Record with Execution Transfer

·
   End of File Record without Execution Transfer

·
   Comment

·
   Start Linear Address Record (32‐bit format only)

General Record Format

Record Type.
   Each record begins with a single byte Record Type field which
   specifies the record type of this record. The Record Type field is
   used to interpret the remaining information within the record. This
   field is one byte, represented as two hexadecimal characters. The
   encoding for all the current record types are:

   1
      Data Record

   2
      End of File Record with Execution Transfer

   3
      End of File Record without Execution Transfer

   5
      Comment Record

Record Length
   Each record has a single byte Record Length field which specifies the
   number of bytes of information or data which follows the Record
   Length field of the record. The maximum value of the Record Length
   field is hexadecimal “FF” or 255. In the case of Data Records only,
   Record Length byte values of zero to two are considered to be lengths
   of 256 to 258, respectively.

Address
   Data and End records have a two‐byte Address field in little‐endian
   byte order. For Data records, this is the starting address at which
   to load the remaining payload of the record. In End records, this is
   the address for the start of execution of the file, or zero if not
   applicable.

Data
   | Each record has a variable length Data field, it consists of zero
     or more bytes. The interpretation of this field depends on the
     Record Type field.
